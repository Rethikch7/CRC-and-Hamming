# Objective
- Simulating realistic error detection and correction by implementing Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC) and 7-bit Hamming code using binary symmetric channel and random
error generation.
- A digital data stream is entered and Hamming Code helps in detecting and correction of data.
- CRC helps in detecting error in the given data after a certain number of hops.
- Language used: JAVA-15
- IDE used: IntelliJ Idea
  ## CRC
- Cyclic Redundancy Check.
- It is a common code for error detection in raw data due to accidental changes.
 ## Hamming Code
- It was developed by R.W. Hamming for error correction.
- In this coding method, the source encodes the message by inserting redundant bits within the message. These redundant bits are extra bits that are generated and inserted at specific positions in the message itself to enable error detection and correction. When the destination receives this message, it performs recalculations to detect errors and find the bit position that has error.
